### Paket Integration

Integration with the widely used and universally loved package manager (created by the F# community) [Paket](http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) allows for easy management of application dependencies, with none of the headaches of trying use NuGet with a version control system.

### FAKE Integration

Integration with the gold standard of .NET build tools, [FAKE](http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/) (also created by the F# community) lets you run build targets within the comfort of the Atom Editor and Visual Studio Code.
